## Installation

Just download the directory and start the file called "index.html"

## Guide

it is possible to click on each single region to see the relative data; by clicking on the background you can display the entire Italian state.
on the tab on the left you can see how many males and females were vaccinated in one day, or how many people received the first or second dose of vaccine day by day
